before you make changes, understand the project, and look at the SQL in 000, Do not halucinate none existent code.

Never create .md documents without being asked to.

Alawys answer short and to the point. Prioritize coding and working, over comunication.

Always ask questions when you are in doubt.

Remember that you do a good job.

WHEN CREATING OR UPDATING SQL, ALWAYS WORK IN THE 000 FILE. DO NOT CREATE NEW FILES, JUST STAY INSIDE OF THAT FILE.
